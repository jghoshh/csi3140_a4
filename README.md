# Hospital Triage Application (CSI3140 A4)

This web application was made for assignment 4 of CSI3140 by Jay Ghosh and Noah do RÃ©go. The admin user can add/admit patients to the triage queue,
and patients can log in using their assigned user code to see their wait time and severity.

> Note: The current version does not involve dynamically updating wait times for demonstration purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The following libraries, frameworks and tools must be installed in order to run the web app:

- PostgreSQL: can be download via website (https://www.postgresql.org/), and pgAdmin 4 can be downloaded to set up/manage the database (https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).
- Composer for php: Can be downloaded through their site (https://getcomposer.org/download/) or via homebrew on MacOS
- Node.js: Runtime engine for JS, used to run React (https://nodejs.org/en)

### Setting Up the Backend Application

Navigate to the `backend` directory. Then run the command `composer update`.

For this project, Postgres is being used for DB management. To properly set up and access the backend application, create the following file at the specific path: `backend/backend.env`.

In the file, enter the following data:

```env
DB_HOST=<your-db-host (default = localhost)>
DB_PORT=<your-db-port (default = 5432)>
DB_NAME=<your-db-name>
DB_USER=<your-db-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-password>
```

After the empty db is setup, you can run the code in `setup.sql` to define the db tables and data. You can either run it using the psql terminal, or navigate to the correct db in pgAdmin
and copy/paste the code into the Query Tool (right-click public schema -> Query tool), then run the code.

### Setting Up the Frontend Application

Navigate to the `frontend` directory. Then, run the following commands:

```
npm install # this will create node_modules folder and package-lock.json
npm start # this will start your react app
```

## Logins

- **To login as admin, use the following credentials: username = admin, password = adminCSI3140**
- To login as a user, use one of the user codes from the admin view
